Create directory hierarchy from information contained in a text file.

so imagine you file contains:

    one
	    two
    three
	    four
	    five
		    one
		    two
		    three
	    hello
		    sev
		    dev
		    bin

you can run this app and pass the txt file like:
dotnet mkdir.dll folders.txt

it will end up creating the following directory sturcture:

    ├── one
    │   └── two
    └── three
        ├── five
        │   ├── one
        │   ├── three
        │   └── two
        ├── four
        └── hello
            ├── bin
            ├── dev
            └── sev

and thats it!
